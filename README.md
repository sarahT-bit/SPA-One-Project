# SPA-One-Project

Project overview and purpose:
The objective is for the user to type in a solution for x for each linear equation
that is presented. 

Features and Functionality: 

1.The SPA contains a background of math symbols (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to make the SPA more visually appealing.

2. If the user is correct, then a check mark emoji will be displayed along with a message saying "Correct!".
   
3. If the user types in the wrong answer, then a red 'X' emoji will appear and 
display a message saying " Incorrect. Try again" and also tell the user how many attempts they have left to solve that problem. If they get it wrong the next two attempts (they get three in total), then the correct answer will be revealed and  the next problem will be shown. 

4. If the user's score ranges from 8-10, a trophy emoji will be displayed alomg 
with the message " WAY TO GO!".

5. If the user's score ranges from 6-7, a thumbs up emoji will be displayed along with the message "SO CLOSE!".
   
6. If the user's score is 5 or under, a smiley face emoji will be displayed along with the message "Good attempt! Let's try again".

Known Issues or Limitations 
When conversing with ChatGPT, I noticed how there was no restart button for the user to click on after the user receives their score. So I requested AI to add one and it did (making this an easy fix). 

Future Enhancement Ideas: 
I could give the user various options on what kind of math they want to do practice problems on depending on what grade they're in. For instance, elementary school and high school.
